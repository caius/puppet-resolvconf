## Overview

Apply configuration to `resolv.conf` using `resolvconf(8)`. Useful on FreeBSD where `resolv.conf` is entirely managed by `resolvconf(8)`.

## Setup

### What resolvconf affects

Tested on:

* FreeBSD 10.1

Things changed at apply time:

* `resolvconf.conf`
* `resolvconf -u` called when changes are applied to make sure `resolv.conf` is updated

### Beginning with resolvconf

Put the following in a node definition:

    class { resolvconf:
      name_servers => "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4",
      search_domains => "test.example.com",
    }

This will result in your `resolv.conf` looking like:

    # Generated by resolvconf
    search test.example.com
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4

## Usage

All the basic variables available to `resolvconf.conf` are definable using the module. Some of them are space separated, just assign them as a single string in puppet as you could in `resolvconf.conf` and `resolvconf(8)` will take care of them.

[man 8 resolvconf](http://stuff.onse.fi/man?program=resolvconf&section=8) on your system for more information.

## Limitations

Currently tested on FreeBSD 10.1.
